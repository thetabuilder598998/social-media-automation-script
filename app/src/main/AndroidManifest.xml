    <!-- Problem Statement: To efficiently manage social media content across multiple platforms, 
         users require robust permission management to ensure the application can operate seamlessly. -->

    <!-- This permission allows the application to access the internet, which is crucial 
         for connecting to social media platforms for content scheduling and management. -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

    <!-- This permission enables the application to read and write to the device's storage, 
         which is essential for saving media files that are used in automated content postings. -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

    <!-- Problem Statement: To ensure a smooth user experience, the application must handle background tasks 
         continuously, providing uninterrupted content management services. -->

             Problem: Users need a straightforward interface to configure and manage their social media content.
             Solution: MainActivity provides a user-friendly graphical interface for easy configuration without 
             any coding required, aligning with MadHub’s feature of no scripting needed. -->

        <!-- The AutomationService handles the core functionalities of scheduling and posting content automatically. 
             Problem: Managing social media content requires 24/7 operations, which cannot be conducted manually at all times.
             Solution: AutomationService enables the application to perform automated content posting in the background, 
             ensuring continuous operation in line with MadHub’s ability to support 24/7 automated tasks. -->
